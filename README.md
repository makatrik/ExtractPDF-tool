ExtractPDF tool presented here, has been developed to automate information extraction from unstructured portable document format (pdf) files. ExtractPDF is a data extraction tool/software that provides a reliable computational workflow for extracting words or combinations of words from pdfs, developed in R. ExtractPDF, is intuitive, it has broad applicability of various stages of the review process, it can act as second investigator in human-led review studies. The tool is not computationally demanding or costly and can be easily downloaded and run on the computer of the uses/reviewers.
There is no limitation in the number of files that can be processed simultaneously and since the extracted information can be customized into the software, it can easily adapt to the review study topic. The toolâ€™s performance and reliability were found to be very good with metrics of averagely 0.89 for precision, 0.92 for recall, 0.86 for accuracy and 0.91for F1-score.
